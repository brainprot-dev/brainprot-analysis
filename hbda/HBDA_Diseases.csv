Tuberous Sclerosis,D014402,C0041341,13515,C3424,7830,,,0001734,344288,,191100,"Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder that affects multiple organs of the body. It is brought on by mutations in the tumour suppressor genes TSC1 or TSC2, which control cell division and growth. TSC1 and TSC2 genes encoding for proteins hamartin and tuberin form a protein complex that controls the activity of mTOR, a protein that is essential for controlling cell growth and proliferation. In TSC, mutations in either TSC1 or TSC2 cause overactivation of the mTOR pathway, which causes benign tumours known as hamartomas across multiple organs. Brain hamartomas can affect neuronal circuits' ability to operate normally, resulting in seizures, cognitive decline, and other neurological symptoms. The severity and specific type of neurological symptoms that people with TSC suffer might vary depending on the location and size of the hamartomas, as well as other individual characteristics. Depending on the patient's unique symptoms and demands, treatment usually entails a combination of drugs, surgery, and supportive therapy."
Tay-Sachs Disease,D013661,C0039373,3320,C85184,7737,,,0010100,11713,845,272800,"Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) is a rare genetic disorder brought on by mutations in the HEXA gene, which produces the enzyme beta-hexosaminidase A's alpha subunit. Gangliosides, a particular class of fatty acids prevalent in the nervous system, are broken down by this enzyme. HEXA gene mutations lead to beta-hexosaminidase A deficiency resulting in gangliosides accumulation in the brain and other areas of the nervous system. It interferes with normal cellular processes and causes the gradual death of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. In the early stages of the disease, affected individuals appear normal, but as the disease progresses, the accumulation of gangliosides leads to inflammation, swelling, and damage to nerve cells, which leads to the onset of symptoms such as muscle weakness, loss of motor skills, and seizures. In the later stages of the disease, affected individuals may experience blindness, deafness, and an inability to swallow or breathe. Death usually occurs by the age of four. At the molecular level, the accumulation of gangliosides in TSD results in the disruption of various cellular processes, including ion channel function, membrane trafficking, and synaptic transmission. The accumulation of gangliosides also triggers a cascade of inflammatory and immune responses that further damage nerve cells and exacerbate the pathophysiology of the disease."
Schizophrenia,D012559,C0036341,5419,C3362,,,HP:0100753,0005090,48574,3140,181500,"Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder that is characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, and impaired social and occupational functioning. Although the fundamental causes of schizophrenia are not fully known, there are several theories that explain the illness, including the dopamine and glutamate hypotheses. According to the dopamine theory, delusions and hallucinations are caused by the brain misinterpreting the firing of dopaminergic neurons. Deficits in working memory may also result from a reduction in D1 receptors in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  According to the glutamate theory, alterations in glutaminergic neurons affect how signals are transmitted from the thalamus to the cortex. A diminished NMDA receptor's expression similarly resembles the symptoms of schizophrenia. Environmental variables may also play a role in the onset of schizophrenia in addition to hereditary ones. Stress, trauma, and drug misuse have all been connected to a higher likelihood of acquiring the condition."
Rett Syndrome,D015518,C0035372,1206,C75488,5696,,,0010726,48441,778,312750,"Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that manifests itself in the first 6-18 months of age and mainly affects females. Numerous neurological and developmental problems constitute its hallmark symptoms. Mutations in the MECP2 gene, which is found on the X chromosome that normally codes for a protein known as methyl-CpG-binding protein 2, result in Rett syndrome. By attaching to DNA and assisting in regulating the activity of certain genes, this protein is crucial in controlling gene expression. Rett syndrome is brought on by mutations in the MECP2 gene, which interfere with this regulatory function and cause aberrant gene expression. In the cells of the locus coeruleus, genetic deletion of the MECP2 gene results in hyperexcitability and diminished noradrenergic innervation. Studies have also revealed a decrease in the size and quantity of dendritic spines, which are the microscopic projections on neurons that provide intercellular communication. The cognitive and developmental symptoms of Rett syndrome are assumed to be a result of this decrease in dendritic spine density. For individuals suffering from Rett syndrome, changes in the concentration of neurotransmitters like dopamine may potentially be a factor in the occurrence of seizures."
Prion Disease,D017096,C0162534,649,C128346,,hsa05020,,0005429,56445,,,"Prion diseases, also known as transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are a class of atypical neurodegenerative illnesses that are caused by aberrant proteins known as prions. Normal prion proteins can misfold into an aberrant, infectious form, which leads to prion disorders. The aggregation of misfolded proteins can cause other normal prion proteins to misfold leading to the destruction of brain tissue and the onset of neurodegenerative symptoms. The body's proteases, which ordinarily break down proteins, are unable to break down the primary prion protein (PrP). They develop into very stable states and as a result persist in the brain for longer periods of time. Amyloid plaques are aberrant aggregates that form as a result of the accumulation of misfolded prion proteins at the cellular level and are harmful to brain cells. Additionally, microglial cells, which are immune cells in the brain involved in inflammation and the elimination of injured cells, become active in prion diseases, leading to neuroinflammation. The prion diseases also result in the gradual loss of brain tissue leading to dementia, mobility difficulties, and mental symptoms. The area of the brain that is damaged determines the distinctive symptoms of prion disorders."
Prader-Willi Syndrome,D011218,C0032897,11983,C75463,5575,,,0008300,46057,739,176270,"Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by a loss of function of paternally inherited genes in the chromosome 15q11-q13 region. In most cases, this lack of expression is due to a deletion of the paternal copy of this region, although other genetic abnormalities can also lead to PWS. The persistent hunger, or hyperphagia, that is seen in PWS patients is thought to be a result of the SNORD116 gene's lack of expression in this area. Studies have also revealed that individuals with PWS have altered levels of various hormones involved in controlling hunger, including leptin and ghrelin. The hyperphagia observed in this condition is believed to be caused by abnormalities in hormone levels. Patients with PWS also experience behavioural issues, sleep apnea, and low muscle tone, which makes performing motor tasks challenging. People with PWS may have abnormalities in the production of hormones, including growth hormone and gonadotropin-releasing hormone leading to abnormal body composition, reduced body mass and hypogonadism."
Post-traumatic Stress Disorder,D013313,C0038436,2055,C3389,,,,0005146,21345,,,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health disease that results due to being a part of or witnessing a traumatic event. When a stressful experience ensues in an excessive adrenaline response and forms persistent neurological patterns in the brain, PTSD symptoms may appear. High levels of stress hormones that are released after traumatic events limit hypothalamic function, which may be a major factor in the development of PTSD. Additionally, studies have shown that PTSD sufferers have altered brain physiology. For instance, research on brain imaging has revealed that PTSD sufferers have an overactive amygdala, which is important for processing emotions. The prefrontal cortex, which is important in controlling emotions and making decisions, is hypoactive at the same time. These modifications to the anatomy and functioning of the brain may be a factor in the symptoms of PTSD."
Plexiform Neurofibroma,D018318,C0206728,5151,C3797,,,HP:0009732,0003304,64640,,,"Plexiform neurofibromas are benign tumours that develop in the myelin sheath in peripheral nerve tissue. They are linked to the inherited condition known as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which is caused by mutations in the NF1 gene. The NF1 gene encodes a protein called neurofibromin, which aids in controlling cell division and proliferation. Non-myelinating Schwann cells express the inactive form of the NF1 gene resulting in low levels of neurofibromin leading to tumour formation. The cells then multiply quickly, resulting in hyperplasia. Mast cells are attracted to these cells by the chemo attractants they emit. Mast cells release mitogens that change the microenvironment of a growing tumour and cause the development of neurofibromas. Although plexiform neurofibromas can manifest at any age, they are often identified in children. They can occur anywhere in the body but are generally found in the peripheral nerves, especially those near the skin or internal organs. Plexiform neurofibromas can either be asymptomatic or, if they develop in conspicuous places like the face, might result in deformity or functional impairment."
Pituitary Adenoma,D049912,C0032000,3829,,,,HP:0002893,0006373,45933,99408,,"Pituitary Gland Adenomas are benign tumors that occur in the pituitary gland. The majority of pituitary adenomas originate from changes or mutations in the genes that control cell division and development. For instance, changes in the MEN1 or AIP genes can increase the chance of acquiring pituitary adenomas. Pituitary adenomas can also arise as a result of changes in the activity of signalling pathways including the Wnt/beta-catenin pathway or the MAPK/ERK pathway. Hormone secretion from pituitary adenomas can cause the body to suffer from hormonal abnormalities. The type of hormone the tumour produces depends on the type of cells it originates from. For instance, hyperprolactinemia, a disease marked by increased prolactin levels in the blood, can be driven by prolactin-secreting adenomas. Growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), among other hormones, can be secreted by various types of adenomas leading to diseases such as Acromegaly and Cushing's disease. Small adenomas might not display any symptoms and be found by chance during a physical examination. Due to the compression of nearby brain regions, larger adenomas might result in headaches, visual issues, or other neurological symptoms."
Parkinson's Disease,D010300,C3160718,60892,C26845,10251,hsa05012,,0008199,463618,411602,168600,"Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that primarily impacts one's ability to coordinate one's movements. In the substantia nigra area of the brain, dopamine-producing neurons gradually start to disappear. A combination of genetic as well as environmental factors play a role in the manifestation of this disease. Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, which are neuronal clumps of misfolded alpha-synuclein protein, are the characteristic pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). These aggregates are believed to interfere with cellular activity and trigger the neurodegenerative process. Another important element in PD development is oxidative stress. Due to its high metabolic activity and large concentrations of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the brain is particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Mutations in the SNCA gene, which codes for the alpha-synuclein protein, mutations in the LRRK2 gene, which codes for the leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 protein, and mutations in the PARKIN, PINK1, and DJ-1 genes, which are involved in mitochondrial function and oxidative stress, have all been linked to the development of PD. In Substantia Nigra, the alpha-synuclein protein misfolds and clumps, causing cytotoxicity and resulting in Brain cell death. This area of the brain is related to motor pathways; hence the disease affects motor functions."
Paraganglioma,D010235,C0030421,50773,C3308,,,HP:0002668,0000448,10571,,168000,"Paragangliomas are rare tumors that arise from neural crest-derived cells called paraganglia. These tumors can occur anywhere along the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, including the adrenal medulla, extra-adrenal sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, and the head and neck region. Paragangliomas can be caused by inherited mutations in genes such as SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, and SDHAF2, which encode subunits of the succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) enzyme complex. Mutations in other genes such as MAX, TMEM127, and VHL can also cause paragangliomas. As these genes are involved in cellular metabolism, oxygen sensing, and tumour suppression, so mutations in these genes contribute to paraganglioma. Paragangliomas with SDH mutations are associated with alterations in cellular metabolism, including an increase in glycolysis and a decrease in oxidative phosphorylation. These metabolic changes are thought to be linked to the development and progression of these tumors. Paragangliomas can secrete catecholamines, which can cause symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and sweating. Local symptoms from these tumours include pain and mass in the afflicted region. The stabilisation of HIF and the activation of downstream pathways, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which support tumour angiogenesis and proliferation, are further effects of SDH and VHL gene mutations in PGLs."
Panic Disorder,D016584,C0030319,594,C34890,,,,0005383,14588,,167870,"Panic disorder (PD) is a form of anxiety disorder that are characterized by abrupt, frequent bouts of intense fear or discomfort that peak in a matter of minutes. The abrupt onset of extreme anxiety known as a panic attack can include palpitations, sweating, shaking, shortness of breath, numbness, or the perception that something terrible is about to occur. The imbalance of several neurotransmitters, including serotonin, norepinephrine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), has been linked to panic disorder. These neurotransmitters have an impact on how we feel, how anxious we are, and how we react in times of danger. Since the amygdala is the location of the fear response, anomalies in this brain region may cause an excessive fear response to events that are not life-threatening in people with panic disorder. Environmental factors, such as stress and trauma, may also contribute to the development of PD. Exposure to stressful or traumatic events may lead to alterations in the brain and dysregulation of the stress response, increasing the risk of developing PD."
Neurofibromatosis,D017253,C0162678,8712,C6727,10420,,HP:0001067,0021061,58149,,,"Neurofibromatosis (NF) is a hereditary condition that interferes with the growth and development of neural tissue, which leads to the development of benign tumours. Specific gene mutations, such as those in the NF1 and NF2 genes, are the root cause of neurofibromatosis. These genes are tumour suppressors genes, which often aid in preventing uncontrolled growth and division of cells. Tumours and other diseases can develop as a result of mutations in these genes. Among the three varieties of neurofibromatosis are: The most prevalent kind of neurofibromatosis is known as neurofibromatosis kind 1 (NF1), sometimes referred to as von Recklinghausen disease. Mutations in NF1 gene that normally encodes for neurofibromin cause neurofibromatosis 1. In addition to bone abnormalities and learning impairments, NF1 is characterised by the emergence of neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and other skin abnormalities. Furthermore, it can raise the risk of gliomas of the optic pathway, scoliosis, and cardiovascular disease. Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2) – NF2 is triggered by mutations in the NF2 gene, which codes for the merlin protein. Vestibular schwannomas or acoustic neuromas, which form on the nerves that regulate hearing and balance, are the hallmark of NF2. It can also result in ependymomas and meningiomas, which are tumours of the neurological system, as well as cataracts and other abnormalities of the eyes. An unusual type of neurofibromatosis called schwannomatosis is caused by mutations in the SMARCB1 and LZTR1 genes. Multiple schwannomas, which are tumours that arise from cells known as Schwann cells in peripheral nervous tissue. Adults are frequently afflicted, and the affected areas may experience persistent discomfort, weakness, and numbness."
Neuroendocrine Tumor,D018358,C0349535 ,169,NCIT:C4637,,,,0021533,138099,,114900,"Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a class of neoplastic tumours that develop from hormone-producing and -releasing cells in the endocrine and neurological systems. These tumours can develop in the gastrointestinal system, lungs, pancreas, and other organs, among other places in the body. Biogenic amines and polypeptide hormones are produced by secretory granules, which are characteristic of neuroendocrine tumours. Numerous genetic and epigenetic changes contribute to NETs, which result in aberrant cell proliferation and hormone release. Common NET mutations include those in the MEN1, DAXX, and ATRX genes as well as changes to the PI3K-AKT-mTOR signalling pathway. NETs can cause a condition known as carcinoid syndrome, which is characterized by the production and release of serotonin and other hormones that cause flushing, diarrhoea, and other symptoms. Chromogranin A (CgA), which is found in 99% of metastatic carcinoid tumours, urine 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE, gamma-gamma dimer), and synaptophysin (P38) are the most significant biomarkers of NETs. The kind and location of the tumour, its stage and grade, the presence of any underlying genetic abnormalities or other risk factors, and other variables all affect how NETs are treated."
Neuroblastoma,D009447,C0027819,769,C3270,7185,,HP:0003006,0005072,18012,635,,"Neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that arises from developing nerve cells, usually found in the adrenal glands, but can also occur in other areas of the body, such as the neck, chest, and spine. It is the most common type of solid tumour in infants and young children. Neuroblastoma is characterized by the uncontrolled proliferation of undifferentiated and immature nerve cells, which leads to the formation of a tumour mass. The tumors can grow rapidly and metastasize to other parts of the body, such as the bone marrow, liver, and lymph nodes. Symptoms of neuroblastoma depend on the location and size of the tumour, but can include abdominal pain, swelling, and distension, as well as bone pain and neurological symptoms, such as weakness or numbness in the limbs. Neuroblastoma involves the disruption of normal cellular processes that regulate cell growth and differentiation. Genetic mutations and chromosomal abnormalities, such as amplification of the MYCN oncogene and deletion of chromosome 1p, 3p, 4p, 11q, and 14q, are commonly associated with neuroblastoma. Neuroblastoma formation and progression are also influenced by dysregulation of the RAS-MAPK and PI3K-AKT signalling pathways, as well as alterations to the expression of genes involved in cell cycle control and apoptosis. There are four phases: stage 1, where the disease is localised without risk factors, stage 2, where the disease is localised with risk factors, and stages 3 and 4, define the metastatic version of the tumour."
Neurilemmoma,D009442,C1336543,3201,C5421,,,,0002554,236964,,,"Neurilemmoma, also known as schwannoma is a benign tumour that grows in Schwann cells which are responsible for myelination of neurons in peripheral nerves. These tumors can occur anywhere in the body but are most commonly found in the head, neck, and extremities. Neurilemmoma involves mutations in the NF2 tumour suppressor gene, which codes for a protein called Merlin or Schwannomin. Merlin acts as a regulator of cell proliferation and interacts with other signalling pathways to suppress tumorigenesis. Mutations in the NF2 gene lead to loss of Merlin function and subsequent overgrowth of Schwann cells, resulting in tumour formation. These tumours have a specific biomarker S-100 which is found in all the variants. These tumors are slow-growing and encapsulated, but they can still cause symptoms by compressing adjacent nerves, blood vessels, or organs. Common symptoms of neurilemmomas include pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the affected area."
Narcolepsy,D009290,C0027404,8986,C84489,7162,,HP:0030050,0021107,45001,619284,161400,"Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease that is characterised by decreasing ability to regulate sleep-wake cycle. It comprises of excessive daytime sleepiness and brief involuntary sleep periods. One of the main genetic factors associated with narcolepsy is the HLA-DQB1 gene, which is involved in the immune system. Specifically, a variation of this gene called HLA-DQB1*06:02 is strongly associated with narcolepsy with cataplexy, a subtype of narcolepsy. This gene variation may lead to the autoimmune response of hypocretin (also known as orexin) releasing neurons in the lateral hypothalamus, which are responsible for regulating sleep and wakefulness. Orexin neurons form an integral part in the regulation of sleep, arousal and transitions between these states. Loss of these neurons leads to disrupted sleep-wake cycles and an inability to maintain normal wakefulness during the day. Other factors that may contribute to the development of narcolepsy include viral infections, such as the H1N1 flu virus, as well as autoimmune disorders. These conditions can trigger an immune response that attacks the hypocretin neurons in the brain. Additionally, narcolepsy is associated with an increase in the level of the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which inhibits the activity of hypocretin neurons. This increased inhibition may contribute to the loss of hypocretin neurons in narcolepsy."
Muscular Dystrophy,D009136,C0026850,9884,C84910,7922,,HP:0003560,0020121,44527,98473,,"Muscular Dystrophy are a group of genetically neuromuscular diseases that induce the gradual weakening and degeneration of skeletal muscles over time. The most prevalent type among the 30 various types of MDs is Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. DMD is caused by mutations in the DMD gene, which produces the dystrophin protein. The structure and functionality of muscle fibers, including those in the brain, are maintained by dystrophin. Muscular fibers deteriorate and suffer injury without functioning dystrophin, which causes gradual muscular atrophy. In addition to muscle weakness, individuals with DMD may also experience cognitive and behavioural problems due to the effects of the genetic mutation on the brain. This is because dystrophin is also found in certain areas of the brain, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. the loss of dystrophin in the brain may lead to abnormal neuronal signalling and disruption of neural circuits. This can result in a range of neurological and psychiatric symptoms, including learning and memory deficits, attention problems, and mood disorders. Muscular dystrophies can be autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X-linked recessive."
Multiple Sclerosis,D009103,C0026769,2377,C3243,10255,,,0005301,10123,802,612594,"Multiple sclerosis is the most common form of demyelinating disease that affects the myelin sheath that surrounds neurons in the brain and spinal cord. The autoimmune reaction that causes multiple sclerosis originates from a combination of genetic, viral, and environmental factors. MS has been related to a number of environmental variables, including low vitamin D levels, smoking, and exposure to viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus and human herpesvirus 6. Over time, MS can lead to the loss of nerve cells and the destruction of brain tissue, which can cause permanent neurological damage and disability. MS has three stages- Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) – which alternates between disease and remission states and may lead to complete recovery, Secondary progressive MS (SPMS)- In this stage, the disease becomes more steadily progressive, with fewer periods of remission and more disability over time, and Primary progressive MS (PPMS) - This form of MS affects around 10-15% of people with the disease, and is characterized by a gradual worsening of symptoms from the onset, with little or no remission. People with PPMS may experience a variety of symptoms, including difficulty walking, muscle weakness, spasticity, and problems with coordination and balance."
Motor Neuron Disease,D016472,C0085084,231,,,,,0020128,38785,98503,,"Motor neuron disease, commonly known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. Clinical symptoms include tight muscles, twitches, weakness, and atrophy of the muscles. Voluntary muscular action is impacted by motor neuron system degeneration at all levels. Numerous gene sets and cell regulation are involved in the ALS disease process. The upper motor neurons of the motor cortex and the lower motor neurons of the brain stem and spinal cord are most frequently affected by degeneration. The pathophysiological sign of ALS is the appearance of inclusion bodies, or abnormal TDP-43 protein aggregations known as Bunina bodies, in the cytoplasm of motor neurons. Several genes for protein breakdown, including SOD1, OPTN, DCTN1, PFN1, etc contribute significantly to ALS progression. The most often mutated gene in ALS, C9orf72, triggers motor neuron death via a variety of mechanisms. Excitotoxicity, or the death of nerve cells brought on by excessive stimulation from the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, is a process that is believed to be present in all types of ALS. Because they have a lesser calcium-buffering capacity and a specific glutamate receptor (the AMPA receptor), motor neurons are more susceptible to excitotoxicity than other types of neurons. Excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), the primary transporter that removes glutamate from synapses, is present at lower levels in ALS patients, which results in elevated synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity."
Meningioma,D008579,C0025286,3565,C3230,7015,,HP:0002858,0016642,7532,2495,,"Meningioma is a slow growing tumour that affects the meninges, which are the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord. With approximately thirty percent of all primary brain tumour cases being this kind, it is the most prevalent. The neurofibromatosis 2 gene, which is found on chromosome 22, is mutated in the majority of meningiomas. The merlin protein, which is produced by this gene, has a role in controlling cell division and proliferation. Tumour formation and unregulated cell proliferation are both possible outcomes of NF2 gene mutations. In benign skull-base meningiomas, mutations in the TRAF7, KLF4, AKT1, and SMO genes are frequently observed. Although meningioma tumour grows slowly, it can put pressure on the brain and surrounding tissues, leading to a range of symptoms such as headaches, seizures, visual disturbances, and weakness in the limbs. The severity of these symptoms depends on the size and location of the tumour. Meningioma is divided into three grades depending on its severity- Grade 1 or benign tumour, Grade 2 or atypical tumour and Grade 3 or Malignant tumour. They are usually benign (non-cancerous), but in rare cases, they can become malignant and spread to other parts of the body."
Meningitis,D008581,C0025289,9471,C26828,,,HP:0001287,0021108,6298,,,"Meningitis is an acute or chronic inflammation of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. The most common cause of it is an infection with a bacterial, viral, or fungal pathogen that infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS) directly from adjacent structures or through the circulation. The bacterium that causes bacterial meningitis invades the meninges and sets off an inflammatory reaction that weakens the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB normally acts as a protective barrier between the CNS and the bloodstream, but in meningitis, the inflammation disrupts the BBB, allowing immune cells and toxins to enter the CNS. The presence of bacteria in the CNS triggers the activation of immune cells, which release cytokines and chemokines that further exacerbate the inflammation and cause tissue damage. In severe cases, the inflammation can lead to increased intracranial pressure, cerebral oedema, and brain herniation. Viral meningitis has a similar pathophysiology, but the inflammation is typically less severe and the BBB is less likely to be disrupted. Fungal meningitis is less common, but can be particularly severe in immunocompromised individuals. The most common symptom of meningitis include headache followed by neck stiffness."
Medulloblastoma,D008527,C0025149,0050902,C3222,7005,,HP:0002885,0007959,7517,616,155255,"Medulloblastoma is a type of brain tumour that primarily affects children. It arises from the cerebellum, that controls movement and coordination. It is said to originate from immature cells called neural progenitor cells, which normally give rise to various types of brain cells. The tumour cells can invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by genetic alterations in the WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 subgroups, which lead to abnormal activation of key signalling pathways involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Each subgroup has distinct molecular features and clinical characteristics. The WNT subgroup is characterized by mutations in the WNT signalling pathway, and it has a better prognosis than other subgroups. The SHH subgroup is the most common, with mutations in the PTCH1, SMO, and SUFU genes, and it can occur in both children and adults. The Group 3 and Group 4 subgroups have a worse prognosis and are less well understood at the molecular level. Other common genetic alterations include amplifications of MYC and deletions of PTEN and CDKN2A/B. Certain genetic syndromes, such as Gorlin syndrome and Turcot syndrome, increase the risk of developing medulloblastoma. Common symptoms of medulloblastoma include headaches, nausea, vomiting, balance problems, and difficulty with coordination and movement. In children, it can cause developmental delays and learning difficulties. As the tumour grows, it can cause increased pressure in the brain, leading to additional symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, and changes in personality or behaviour."
Intracranial Aneurysm,D002532,C0007766,10941,C34458,,,,,2960,,105800,"Intracranial Aneurysm, also known as cerebral aneurysm, is a cerebrovascular disorder that describes a bulge in a blood vessel within the brain that can potentially rupture and cause a life-threatening condition called subarachnoid haemorrhage. It causes localised dilation the cerebral artery or vein. Development of intracranial aneurysms is related to abnormalities in the structural proteins that contribute to angiogenesis. These abnormalities can cause weakness in the blood vessel wall and increase the risk of aneurysm formation and rupture. Studies have identified several genes that may be associated with intracranial aneurysms, such as collagen, perlecan, elastin, including genes involved in collagen synthesis, extracellular matrix regulation, and inflammation. intracranial aneurysms involves a complex interplay between hemodynamic forces, inflammation, and vascular remodelling. Hemodynamic forces, such as blood flow and pressure, can cause stress on the blood vessel wall, leading to remodelling and changes in the vessel structure. By weakening the structural integrity of the artery wall through shear stress, inflammatory processes may also play a role in the development and rupture of aneurysms. This process results in the recruitment of mast cells, macrophages, and T cells. The symptoms of intracranial aneurysms may be asymptomatic or can include headaches, visual disturbances, and neurological deficits."
Intellectual Disability,D008607,C3714756,1059,C97250,,,HP:0001249,0001071,811461,319658,,"Intellectual disability, commonly referred to as intellectual developmental disorder (IDD), is a neurodevelopmental condition marked by significant limitations in cognitive functioning and adaptive behaviour. The underlying causes of intellectual disability are diverse and can include genetic, environmental, and/or neurological factors. Intellectual disability can be categorized into two subtypes: syndromic and non-syndromic. Syndromic intellectual disability is characterized by the presence of intellectual deficits as well as other medical and behavioural signs and symptoms. Fragile X syndrome and Down syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Non-syndromic intellectual disability, on the other hand, is characterized by intellectual deficits that occur without any other abnormalities. Environmental factors, such as maternal exposure to alcohol, drugs, or infections during pregnancy, can also contribute to the development of intellectual disability. Additionally, brain damage caused by factors such as birth complications, head injury, or infections can result in intellectual disability. Mutations in genes encoding ion channels, receptors, and enzymes involved in neurotransmitter metabolism have been implicated in intellectual disability. Disruptions in signalling pathways such as the Ras-MAPK pathway, which is important for cell growth and differentiation, have also been linked to intellectual disability. Abnormalities in synaptic function, including deficits in synaptic plasticity and altered neurotransmitter release, have also been observed in individuals with intellectual disability. These changes can result in impaired neuronal communication and altered neural circuitry, which may contribute to the cognitive impairments observed in individuals with intellectual disability. In addition to these molecular and cellular changes, studies have also shown that individuals with intellectual disability often have structural and functional abnormalities in specific brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. These brain regions are involved in higher cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and decision-making, and their dysfunction is thought to contribute to the cognitive deficits observed in individuals with intellectual disability."
Hydrocephalus,D006849,C0020255,10908,C3111,,,HP:0000238,0001150,9335,,,"Hydrocephalus is a neurological condition, characterized by an abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain's ventricles, which elevates intracranial pressure and damages brain tissue. There are two types of hydrocephalus: acquired and congenital. Hydrocephalus occurs in the foetus in cases of congenital hydrocephalus. Meningitis, brain tumours, head trauma, toxoplasmosis, and cerebral haemorrhage are all causes of acquired hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus can arise as a result of some genetic defects in the genes that produce aquaporins, which are water channel proteins. Cerebrospinal fluid production and absorption may be impacted by further genetic abnormalities. The usual equilibrium between the development, circulation, and absorption of cerebrospinal fluid is disrupted in hydrocephalus. The choroid plexus, a region in the brain's ventricles that secretes CSF into the ventricles, normally produces CSF. Following its passage through the ventricles, the fluid enters the subarachnoid space, which surrounds the brain and spinal cord and is where it is absorbed back into the circulation. CSF flow is obstructed in hydrocephalus, which can happen at multiple locations in the ventricular system of the brain or in the subarachnoid region. Inflammation, scarring, or structural irregularities can all be the underlying cause of this blockage. The blockage results in an accumulation of CSF, which can expand the ventricles and increase pressure inside the skull. The increased pressure may harm brain tissue, resulting in neurological and cognitive problems, such as headaches, nausea, vomiting, seizures, vision problems, and developmental delays."
Huntington's Disease,D006816,C0020179,12858,C82342,6677,hsa05016,,0007739,5654,399,143100,"Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurodegenerative disorder that affects the basal ganglia, which controls voluntary movements, cognition, and emotions. As the condition worsens, the frequency of twitching movements increases, which might eventually prevent a person from speaking. The CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence in the DNA is abnormally expanded as a result of the Huntingtin (HTT) gene mutation that causes the disease. Huntingtin, a protein that the HTT gene normally produces, is involved in a number of processes in the brain, including vesicle trafficking along axons, transcriptional regulation, and cell survival. The enlarged polyglutamine (polyQ) tract of the HD huntingtin protein imparts a deleterious gain of function. The protein becomes clumped or aggregated as a result of the enlarged polyQ region, which aggregates in the brain and results in neuronal dysfunction and degeneration. Huntington's disease is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, implying that an afflicted person typically inherits from one of their parents a copy of the gene with an expanded trinucleotide repeat (the mutant allele). Individuals bearing the defective gene will unavoidably acquire the disease due to the high penetrance of the mutation. Impaired proteostasis, which is the inability of cells to maintain the balance between protein production, folding, and degradation, is one of the most significant pathogenic processes in Huntington's disease. The proteostasis network can become overloaded by the presence of misfolded or aggregated proteins, such as mutant huntingtin, which can cause cellular stress and dysfunction. The mutant protein can also alter signalling pathways that are essential for the survival and plasticity of neurons, as well as the activity of other proteins including receptors, ion channels, and transcription factors. Oxidative stress, which originates from an imbalance between the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the antioxidant defence system, is another important pathogenic event in HD. By affecting mitochondrial function and decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the mutant huntingtin protein can increase the production of ROS. Inflammation, apoptosis, and neurodegeneration can result from ROS disrupting lipids, proteins, and DNA. Furthermore, mutant huntingtin may interfere with the movement of vesicles and organelles inside neurons, impairing synaptic function and interregional communication. The expression of synaptic proteins and the amounts of neurotransmitters like glutamate, GABA, and dopamine may both be altered by the protein, which can also change the shape and function of synapses."
Glioma,D005910,C0017638,0060108,C3059,6513,hsa05214,HP:0009733,0021042,9030,182067,137800,"Glioma is the type of brain tumour that develop in the glial cells of brain and spinal cord. They make up around 80% of malignant brain tumours and are the most prevalent primary form of cancer in the brain. According to the results of a pathological investigation, gliomas are divided into four grades: Grade I, which has a minimal risk and allows for a straightforward surgical removal of the tumour, Grade II that are well differentiated tumours but still benign, and Grade III which are undifferentiated and malignant form of the tumour. Glioblastoma is a type of grade IV glioma and is the most aggressive and malignant form of glioma. One of the most common genetic mutations in gliomas is the loss of function of the tumour suppressor gene TP53. Other mutations that are frequently found in gliomas include alterations in the EGFR and PTEN genes. These mutations lead to uncontrolled cell growth and division, which can lead to the formation of a tumour. The molecular biology of gliomas involves complex interactions between glial cells and the surrounding microenvironment. Hypoxia (low oxygen levels), inflammation, and altered metabolism define the cancer microenvironment. These elements facilitate the development, expansion, and invasion of glioma cells into surrounding brain tissue. DNA repair genes including ERCC1, ERCC2 (XPD), and XRCC1 have been associated to an elevated risk of glioma, indicating that inadequate or altered repair of DNA damage may play a role in the development of gliomas. Incomplete DNA repair can result in epigenetic changes or epimutations, whereas DNA damage is thought to be a key driver of cancer growth since it can produce mutations through translesion synthesis. In the development of sporadic glioblastoma, epigenetic repression or silencing of DNA repair genes is frequently observed, such as methylation of the DNA repair gene MGMT promoter, which is seen in 51% to 66% of glioblastoma specimens. IDH 1 or 2 gene mutations are frequently seen in gliomas, and they result in an excess of the metabolic intermediate 2-hydroxyglutarate that binds to the catalytic sites of important enzymes that play a vital role in modifying histone and DNA promoter methylation. Increased oxidative stress brought on by these mutations can result in mutagenic oxidative DNA damage. Therefore, IDH1 or IDH2 mutations behave as driving mutations in the development of glioma, however it is unclear how they function in this capacity."
Glioblastoma,D005909,C0017638,3068,C129295,2491,,HP:0012174,0018177,42228,360,,"Glioblastoma is the most common form of malignant tumour that originates in the astrocytes of the brain. Glioblastoma is characterized by genetic alterations that lead to the activation of multiple signalling pathways involved in cell growth, proliferation, and survival. The EGFR gene is frequently amplified or mutated in glioblastomas, leading to the activation of the EGFR signalling pathway, which is involved in cell growth and proliferation. The tumour suppressor genes, including p53, RB1, and PTEN, are commonly mutated or deleted in glioblastomas, leading to the loss of their tumour-suppressing functions. Isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) gene mutations, which are identified in a subgroup of glioblastomas and are linked with a better prognosis, are one of the other significant genetic changes in glioblastoma. IDH mutations cause the synthesis of the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, which interferes with cellular metabolism and aids in the development of tumours. The RB tumour suppressor pathway, the p16INK4a/cyclin D1/CDK4/6 pathway, and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling system, all of which are essential in controlling cell proliferation and survival, can also be altered in glioblastomas. Due to their high degree of invasiveness and potential to infiltrate nearby brain tissue, glioblastomas are challenging to completely remove surgically. The tumors also disrupt the blood-brain barrier, leading to edema and increased intracranial pressure. The increased pressure can cause symptoms such as headaches, nausea, and vomiting. Glioblastomas secrete various factors that promote angiogenesis, which provide the tumour with the nutrients it needs to grow. The tumors also secrete factors that suppress the immune system, allowing the tumour to evade detection and destruction by immune cells. In addition, glioblastomas can alter the microenvironment of the brain by promoting the migration of cells such as astrocytes and microglia, which can further contribute to tumour growth and invasiveness. Four glioblastoma subtypes have been identified – the EGFR mutation is associated with the classical subtype of glioblastoma, proneural subtype with alterations in TP53, PDGFRA, and IDH-1 genes, mesenchymal subtype with alterations in neurofibromin 1 gene, and neural subtype with expression of neuron markers like NEFL, GABRA1, SYT1, and SLC12A5 and frequently presenting as normal cells upon pathological assessment."
Gilles De La Tourette Syndrome,D005879,C0040517,11119,C35078,7783,,,0007661,21219,856,137580,"Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder, marked by many physical and vocal tics in children and adolescents. Tourette syndrome is largely inheritable, according to genetic research. Several genes that may aid in the development of GTS have been found in recent investigations. Neurotransmitters including dopamine, serotonin, and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are regulated by these genes. The basal ganglia, which are responsible for controlling movement, are thought to be one of the brain regions that may become dysfunctional as a result of imbalances in these neurotransmitters. The distinctive tics noticed in GTS may result from malfunction in this circuit. Tics could be triggered by an increase in other neurotransmitters as a result of a decreased amount of histamine in the H3 receptor. The prefrontal cortex and limbic system may both experience changes in GTS, in addition to anomalies in neurotransmitter regulation and CSTC circuits. While the limbic system plays a role in distinguishing feelings and motivation, the prefrontal cortex is involved in executive tasks like decision-making and impulse control. The onset and aggravation of GTS symptoms may also be influenced by environmental variables including infections and stress."
Gaucher Disease,D005776,C0017205,1926,C61268,8233,,,0018150,42164,355,,"Gaucher disease is a genetic disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme glucocerebrosidase results in accumulation of glucocerebroside in cells, notably in the spleen, brain, liver, and bone marrow. It is an autosomal recessive disease, which means that two copies of the defective gene are necessary for the development of the disease. Both men and women can get the condition, which is caused by a recessive mutation in the GBA gene on chromosome 1. Numerous organs and tissues contain the fatty compound glucocerebroside, which is broken down by the enzyme glucocerebrosidase. A GBA gene mutation causes an enzyme deficit in persons with Gaucher disease, which causes glucocerebroside to accumulate within cells. The accumulation of glucocerebroside can result in liver and spleen enlargement, anaemia, bone pain, and a higher risk of fractures. The severity of the symptoms and the age at which they first show determine the three subtypes of Gaucher disease. Type 1 is the most prevalent form and is characterised by an enlarged spleen and liver, anaemia, and lethargy. Gaucher illnesses types 2 and 3 are less frequent and are characterised by more severe neurological symptoms, such as seizures, loss of motor control, and cognitive impairment."
Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration,D057174,C0751072,60672,,,,,0011842,148228,,,"Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) is a neurodegenerative condition that affects the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It is a diverse condition with several subgroups, each of which has its own unique set of clinical and pathological characteristics. They are FTLD-tau, which is marked by inclusion bodies that express the protein tau, FTLD-TDP, which is marked by accumulations of the protein ubiquitin and the protein TDP-43, and FTLD-FUS, which is marked by inclusion bodies that express the protein FUS. Mutations in the genes encoding the progranulin (GRN), C9orf72, and the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) are the most frequent genetic causes of FTLD. Tau protein builds up as a result of MAPT mutations, forming neurofibrillary tangles and other aggregates in the neurons. The progranulin protein, which is essential for the continued existence and functioning of neurons, is found in lower concentrations as a result of mutations in GRN. The aggregation of aberrant RNA and protein aggregates spurred by C9orf72 mutations is likely to have a role in neuronal dysfunction and death. Additionally contributing to the onset and progression of FTLD include oxidative damage, inflammation, and protein aggregation. In the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, this condition is characterised by the selective degeneration of certain neuronal populations. Numerous symptoms manifest such as anomalies in behaviour, language, and motor skills. The exact mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of certain neurons in FTLD are not well understood. However, it is thought that the specific pattern of protein expression and cellular function in these neurons may render them more susceptible to the pathological mechanisms that contribute to FTLD."

It results in impairments in behaviour, personality, and language. In FTD, aberrant accumulation of proteins occurs in the brain. In most cases of FTD, there is an abnormal build-up of tau protein or TDP-43 protein, which forms clumps called inclusions. In some cases, there is also an accumulation of another protein called FUS. Mutations in the MAPT gene, which provides instructions for making the tau protein, can lead to the abnormal accumulation of tau protein in the brain and cause FTD. Similarly, mutations in the C9ORF72 gene have been linked to the accumulation of abnormal TDP-43 protein and the development of FTD. In addition to genetic factors, environmental factors, and lifestyle choices may also contribute to the development of FTD. For example, head trauma, exposure to toxins, and certain infections have all been suggested as possible risk factors."
Friedreich Ataxia,D005621,C0016719,12705,C84718,6468,,,0100339,5276,,229300,"Friedreich ataxia (FA) is an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease. Mutations in the frataxin (FXN) gene, on chromosome 9q13, leads to Friedreich ataxia (FA). Frataxin, a mitochondrial protein that is crucial in the formation of iron-sulfur clusters (ISCs), which are required for the activity of numerous mitochondrial enzymes involved in energy generation and antioxidant defence, is produced by the FXN gene. FA is characterized by progressive loss of coordination, gait disturbance, muscle weakness, and sensory deficits, typically starting in childhood or adolescence. The symptoms result from degeneration of the dorsal root ganglia, spinocerebellar tracts, and spinocerebellar pathways in the spinal cord and cerebellum. Cardiac involvement, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is also common and can be life-threatening. The primary molecular defect in FA is a deficiency of frataxin protein due to the expansion of a GAA trinucleotide repeat in the first intron of the FXN gene, leading to decreased expression and/or stability of the protein. The number of GAA repeats varies among individuals and correlates inversely with frataxin expression levels and the severity of the disease. Normal individuals typically have up to 33 GAA repeats, while individuals with FA have 66 to 1700 GAA repeats, with longer expansions associated with earlier onset and more severe disease. The GAA repeat expansion leads to epigenetic changes, including heterochromatin formation and histone modifications, that interfere with transcriptional elongation and mRNA processing, resulting in decreased frataxin mRNA levels. The reduced frataxin levels impair the biogenesis and function of ISC-containing proteins, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress. The accumulated oxidative damage leads to progressive neurodegeneration and cardiomyopathy."
Fragile X Syndrome,D005600,C0016667,14261,C84717,6464,,,0010383,8912,908,300624,"Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is a genetic condition, characterized by a mild intellectual impairment. It results from X-linked dominance due to a mutation in the FMR1 gene on the X chromosome. The fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), whose production is regulated by the FMR1 gene, is essential for the growth of neural connections and proper brain function. In FXS, a repeated expansion of the CGG trinucleotide in the FMR1 gene causes little or no FMRP protein to be produced, which impairs brain function and development. Dendritic spine anomalies, which involve an increase in the quantity and length of dendritic spines in certain brain areas, including the neocortex and hippocampus. These anomalies are hypothesised to play a role in the behavioural and cognitive difficulties seen in FXS patients. According to research, FMRP has an impact on signalling pathways such the group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) pathway, which plays a role in long-term depression. FMRP suppressed the synthesis of mRNA, which increased long-term depression. Alterations in neurotransmitter systems and synaptic plasticity are also linked to FXS. With increased glutamate signalling and reduced GABA signalling, there is specifically an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission. The seizures are considered to be caused by this imbalance, and people with FXS frequently exhibit hyperactivity. A variety of cognitive, behavioural, and physical symptoms, such as intellectual impairment, attention difficulties, hyperactivity, social anxiety, and language disorders, are caused by the molecular and pathophysiological abnormalities seen in FXS."
Essential Tremor,D020329,C0270736,4990,C182453,5910,,,0003233,78725,862,190300,"Essential tremor (ET) is a common neurological condition, characterised by repetitive, involuntary, oscillatory movements, most frequently affecting the hands and arms. Essential tremor is often caused by genetic mutations that are inherited in an autosomal dominant form, implying that only one copy of the faulty gene is necessary for the illness to manifest. A LINGO1 gene mutation is one of the most well-known genetic correlations with essential tremor. A LINGO1 mutation has been associated with an increased chance of developing essential tremor. The LINGO1 protein is important in the control of nerve cell development and survival. The genes FUS, TENM4, and STK32B are some additional genes that have been linked to essential tremor. FUS, TENM4. and STK32B genes are involved in regulating RNA, development control of the nervous tissue, and regulation of cell growth and proliferation respectively. Mutations in these genes have been linked to essential tremor and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The cerebellum's neuronal circuitry and its connections to other regions of the brain, such as the thalamus and cortex, are disrupted, which contributes to essential tremor. Movement coordination and regulation are the responsibility of the cerebellum, which also receives information from numerous sensory and motor systems. The cerebellum's excitatory and inhibitory impulses are out of balance in essential tremor, which causes aberrant firing patterns and hyperactivity in certain regions. The thalamus and cortex receive incorrect signals from the cerebellum as a result of this abnormal activity, which affects motor control and causes tremors. The tremors in essential tremor are often absent at rest and are more noticeable during movements."
Epilepsy,D004827,C0014544,1826,C3020,,,,0005027,4506,,,"Epilepsy is a neurological disorder , characterised by recurring, abrupt seizures. When the brain experiences aberrant, synchronous neuronal activity, it causes seizures, which can present clinically as anything from brief moments of bewilderment to convulsions and loss of consciousness. Complex interactions between genetic, structural, and functional variables are involved. In some cases, the disorder may be caused by genetic mutations that affect ion channels, neurotransmitter receptors, or other proteins involved in regulating neuronal excitability. Structural abnormalities such as brain malformations, tumors, and head injuries can also lead to epilepsy. One of the key mechanisms involved in epileptogenesis is the imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signalling in the brain. This can occur due to alterations in the levels or function of neurotransmitters such as glutamate and GABA. Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter that can lead to the overactivation of neurons, while GABA is an inhibitory neurotransmitter that helps to suppress neuronal activity. The diagnosis of epilepsy typically involves a combination of clinical evaluation, electroencephalography (EEG), and imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scans."

Although there are various plausible explanations for inflammation, the most frequent ones are an infection or an autoimmune reaction. When an immune system is activated, as it is in viral encephalomyelitis, cytokines, as well as chemokines are released, which attract immune cells to the brain and spinal cord. In addition to attacking the virus, these immune cells destroy healthy tissue. In autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the immune system unintentionally damages and inflames healthy brain and spinal cord tissue. Genetic and environmental factors may cause an autoimmune reaction to myelin, the insulating coating surrounding nerve fibres in the brain and spinal cord, in autoimmune encephalomyelitis. The autoimmune reaction is brought on by the presentation of self-antigens to immune cells via the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II. Adhesion molecules, cytokines, and chemokines are additional molecules connected to the development of encephalomyelitis. These chemicals help to break down the blood-brain barrier, which ordinarily stops immune cells from penetrating the brain, and to attract and activate immune cells in the brain and spinal cord.."

In most cases, the virus enters the body through the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract and then travels to the brain. Once in the brain, the virus infects the neurons and causes them to produce inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, which attract immune cells such as macrophages and lymphocytes. The immune cells then release more inflammatory molecules, leading to further damage to the brain tissue and blood vessels. The inflammation can also lead to increased permeability of the blood-brain barrier, allowing immune cells and other molecules to enter the brain and cause further damage. Common symptoms for encephalitis include fever, headache, confusion, and sometimes seizures."

Any area of the body, including the face, neck, arms, and legs, might be impacted. The movements usually resemble a tremor. Dystonia may be inherited, or it may result from trauma or an illness. It is believed to have an impact on the basal ganglia, a collection of deep-brain nuclei that are essential for controlling movement. The basal ganglia receive input from multiple regions of the brain, including the cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum, and use this information to modulate the activity of the motor cortex and control movements. Basal ganglia dopamine inhibits the movement while acetylcholine is an excitatory neurotransmitter. Imbalance in the levels of these two neurotransmitters can lead to excessive muscle contractions and abnormal movements or postures. Mutations in DYT1 gene that codes for torsinA protein which is involved in dopamine metabolism might also contribute to dystonia.

When chromosome 21 has an extra copy, the genes on this chromosome are overexpressed, which can cause problems in cellular function. The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is found on chromosome 21, is one of the Down syndrome genes causes beta-amyloid aggregates, and contributes to people's cognitive decline. This may contribute to cellular malfunction, particularly in the brain, which may result in neurological symptoms such as cognitive decline.

The accumulation of misfolded proteins damage and ultimately destroy neuronal cells. Mutations in the prion protein gene can cause the majority of the alpha helical regions of the prion protein to misfold into beta-pleated sheets. This conformational change prevents the digestion of the protein. Once the prion has spread, the damaged proteins reach the brain and, in a continuous feedback loop, induce new prion protein molecules to misfold.

Cerebral Palsy,D002547,C0007789,1969,C34460,,,HP:0100021,0006497,854,,,"Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of neurological disorders that affect movement, coordination, and posture. It is caused by damage to the brain during development, which can occur before, during, or shortly after the birth. One of the main causes of cerebral palsy is hypoxia, which occurs when brain is deprived of oxygen. This can happen during birth due to complications such as placental insufficiency or cord prolapse, or during the neonatal period due to respiratory distress syndrome or other medical conditions. Hypoxia leads to damage to the white matter of the brain, which contains the axons that transmit signals between different parts of the brain and the body. Oxidative stress, chronic inflammation and Excitotoxicity contributes to cerebral palsy. Excitotoxicity occurs when there is excessive activation of glutamate receptors, leading to the influx of calcium ions and cell death. Mutations in genes that are involved in brain development and function, such as those encoding proteins involved in axon guidance, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter signalling, can increase the risk of cerebral palsy. For example, mutations in the ARX gene, which encodes a transcription factor involved in the development of the cerebral cortex, can lead to a type of cerebral palsy known as X-linked lissencephaly with ambiguous genitalia (XLAG). Cerebral palsy is also influenced by environmental factors, such as infections, toxins, and maternal factors such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes."

The main reasons are arrhythmias and arterial blood flow restriction to the brain, typically brought on by thrombosis or embolism. The lack of oxygen and glucose supply impairs the brain's ability to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the main energy source for cellular functions. Energy failure disrupts essential cellular processes, including ion homeostasis, neurotransmitter release, and maintenance of membrane potential. When the ischemia lasts too long, it causes permanent neuronal death, which leads to an ischemic stroke. In contrast to other body parts, the brain experiences ischemia within seconds and necrosis within 5 minutes after total loss of oxygen and glucose. Gliosis with astrocytosis, volume loss, and neuronal shrinkage are some of the long-lasting side effects of brain ischemia. The high basal metabolic rate and robust cell-cell interaction within the brain activate pathways that result in apoptosis and catabolic necrosis along with glutamate-induced neuronal death, dopamine-induced potentiation of ischemia damage, free radical release, zinc toxicity, and enzyme release."

It is caused by formation of blood clot in blood vessel that leads to hypoxia. The brain undergoes a process called necrosis as a result of ischemia. The lack of oxygen and energy supply triggers an imbalance in ion gradients within neurons. This disruption leads to excessive release of neurotransmitters, particularly glutamate, resulting in a process called excitotoxicity. Excess glutamate over activates receptors on neighbouring neurons, leading to an influx of calcium ions and subsequent cellular damage and death. The increased oxidative stress causes damage to cellular structures, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, contributing to the progression of brain injury. Oxidative stress also activates inflammatory responses and further amplifies the damage to brain tissues. Even the blood brain barrier is damaged that allows inflammatory cells, toxins, and other molecules to penetrate the brain tissue, exacerbating the inflammatory response and damaging neurons. Following the initial ischemic event, a cascade of secondary events occurs, leading to additional damage and expansion of the infarcted area. These events include oedema (brain swelling), increased intracranial pressure, and the release of various factors that further perpetuate the inflammatory response and neuronal damage."
Bipolar Disorder,D001714,C0005586,3312,C34423,10249,,,0004985,377615,,125480,"Bipolar disorder, formerly known as manic depression, is characterized by bouts of depression and times of abnormally elevated mood, each lasting anywhere from days to weeks. The mood fluctuates between depressive states and excessively joyful and energetic situations that occurs due to disruptions in neurotransmitter release. In behavioural genetic research, numerous chromosomal areas and candidate genes have been linked to the vulnerability to bipolar illness, with each gene having a weak to moderate influence. Numerous common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were shown to be related to bipolar illness by robust and reproducible genome-wide significant relationships, including variations in the genes CACNA1C, ODZ4, and NCAN. Dysfunctions in ion channels, which regulate the flow of ions across neuronal membranes, have been implicated in bipolar disorder. Variations in ion channel genes, such as those encoding calcium, sodium, and potassium channels, may disrupt neuronal excitability and lead to abnormal firing patterns in the brain. These abnormalities can contribute to mood dysregulation and other symptoms of bipolar disorder. Psychological trauma and stress can also contribute to the development of bipolar disorder."
Autism Spectrum Disorder,D000067877,C1510586,60041,C88412,10248,,,0005258,307153,106,209850,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental syndrome that disrupts a person's ability for social interaction, communication, learning, and general behaviour. ASD is characterised by persistent issues with social interaction, communication, and restricted, repetitive conduct patterns. Neonatal hypoxia, parents older than 40, older siblings with ASD, maternal obesity, and gestational obesity are all evidence-based risk factors for ASD. Genetic modifications linked to ASD include copy number variants and single nucleotide changes. Activities of autism risk genes frequently take on different functions in a variety of brain regions that evolve throughout the course of development in a spatiotemporally defined manner."
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,D001289,C1263846,1094,C97160,,,HP:0007018,0007743,220387,,143465,"Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder having hallmarks namely inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Genetic studies have shown that ADHD is inheritable, with an estimated heritability of 70-80%. Several genes have been associated with ADHD, including genes involved in dopamine signalling, neurotransmitter transporters, and synaptic transmission. The most replicated genetic finding in ADHD is the association with the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), which codes for a protein that regulates dopamine levels in the brain. An increased chance of developing ADHD has also been related to environmental variables such prenatal exposure to drugs, alcohol, or smoking, preterm delivery, low birth weight, and mother stress. The prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, which are involved in attention, motivation, and executive function, are dysfunctional in the pathophysiology of ADHD. According to neuroimaging studies, working memory and attention control are primarily controlled by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which has been linked to lower volume and activity in prefrontal cortex in both children and adults with ADHD. Additionally, the striatum, which is involved in motor control and reward processing, exhibits higher activity. This hyperactivity in the striatum may lead to impulsive behaviour and poor decision-making. Abnormalities in neurotransmitter systems have also been implicated in ADHD. Dopamine and norepinephrine are the primary neurotransmitters involved in attention and executive function, and drugs that increase their levels, such as methylphenidate and amphetamines, are effective in treating ADHD. Serotonin, another neurotransmitter, has also been linked to ADHD, with some studies showing reduced levels in children with ADHD."
Ataxia Telangiectasia,D001260,C0004135,12704,C2887,5862,,,0008840,439,100,208900,"Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive neurodegeneration, immune system dysfunction, and an increased risk of developing cancer. It is primarily caused by mutations in the ATM (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) gene, which is involved in DNA repair and maintenance of genomic stability. Since ATM detects DNA double-strand breaks, it leads to the phosphorylation of various proteins involved in DNA repair, cell cycle checkpoints, and transcription. When the ATM gene is dysfunctional, it can lead to changes in mitochondrial homeostasis, resulting in the development of a number of neurodegenerative disorders. A-T is characterized by immune system abnormalities, including immune deficiency and increased susceptibility to infections. The immune system dysfunction in A-T arises from the impaired development and function of immune cells, such as T and B lymphocytes, accumulation of which results in DNA damage in neuronal cells. Loss of ATM function affects the regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other factors involved in blood vessel integrity, leading to the abnormal dilation and fragility of blood vessels, referred to as telangiectasia."
Aphasia,D001037,C0003537,60046,,,,HP:0002381,0000598,8159,95432,,"Aphasia is the inability to comprehend or construct language due to damage to brain areas, such as Wernicke's or Broca's areas. A brain tumor, a stroke, or neurodegenerative conditions may have brought on the damage. Lesions in the left frontal lobe in Broca's area affect the ability to produce language. This type of aphasia is also known as expressive aphasia. Receptive aphasia, which affects the capacity to perceive language, is caused by lesions in the Wernicke area in the brain's posterior and superior temporal lobes. The most frequent neuroimaging techniques for diagnosing aphasia and determining the degree of frontal and temporal lobe damage and language loss are magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)."
Anxiety Disorder,D001008,C0003469,2030,C2878,,,,0005618,361,,607834,"Anxiety and fear are adaptive reactions preserved throughout evolution due to their importance for survival. Pathological anxiety is the result of persistent anxiety. Experiencing stress during the early stages of life, particularly in the postnatal and childhood years, is linked to an increased risk of mental problems in humans. In GWASs, several genetic variations that predispose to anxiety disorders have been found. Anxiety disorders may result from underlying genetic anomalies like the NMDA glutamate receptor component GRIN2A gene or the major histocompatibility complex area on chromosome 6 near the C4 gene region. Increased TMEM132D expression levels have been linked to higher anxiety in neurons and oligodendrocytes. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) is abundantly expressed in the Amygdala, Hypothalamus, and Frontal cortex, catalyzes the hydrolysis of cAMP, and is involved in anxiety-related behavior. PDE4B has been shown to regulate anxiety-like behavior in mice by increasing anxiety-like behavior when deleted and decreasing anxiety-like behavior when its enzymatic activity is inhibited."
Angelman Syndrome,D017204,C0162635,1932,C75462,5810,,,0007113,58144,72,105830,"Angelman syndrome(AS) is a hereditary condition that primarily affects the neurological system and is characterized by dysmorphic facial traits, intellectual impairment, developmental disability, restrictions in functional speech, balance and mobility issues, seizures, and sleep issues. The syndrome is caused by a dysfunction or insufficient expression of the UBE3A allele inherited from the mother on chromosome 15. Patients with AS may have uniparental disomy of the paternal region of chromosome 15q11.2-q13, deletion of the maternally transmitted UBE3A gene, or imprinting abnormalities on the maternal chromosome. The absence or reduced function of UBE3A disrupts synaptic development and function such as impaired long-term potentiation, leading to the cognitive and behavioural impairments observed in Angelman syndrome. Additionally, UBE3A dysfunction can affect other cellular processes, including protein turnover, cellular signalling pathways, and gene expression regulation. "
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis,D000690,C0002736,332,C34373,5786,hsa05014,HP:0007354,0004976,274,803,105400,"Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, often called a motor neuron disease. Common clinical manifestations include muscle rigidity, muscular fasciculations, weakness, and muscle atrophy. Degeneration at all levels of the motor neuron system impacts voluntary muscle movement. The development of ALS depends on many gene sets and cell regulation. Upper motor neurons in the motor cortex and brain stem as well as lower motor neurons in the brain stem and spinal cord are most commonly affected by degeneration. The pathophysiological sign of ALS is the appearance of inclusion bodies, or abnormal TDP-43 protein aggregations known as Bunina bodies, in the cytoplasm of motor neurons. Protein degradation genes including SOD1, OPTN, DCTN1, PFN1, and others play a crucial role in the development of ALS. The most often mutated gene in ALS, C9orf72, triggers motor neuron death via various mechanisms. Excitotoxicity, or the death of nerve cells brought on by excessive stimulation from the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, is a process believed to be present in all types of ALS. Because they have a lesser calcium-buffering capacity and a specific glutamate receptor (the AMPA receptor), motor neurons are more susceptible to excitotoxicity than other neurons. Excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), the primary transporter that removes glutamate from synapses, is present at lower levels in ALS patients, which results in elevated synaptic glutamate levels and excitotoxicity."
Alzheimer's Disease,D000544,C0002395,10652,C2866,10254,hsa05010,HP:0002511,0004975,1853,238616,104300,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the gradual decline of memory, cognitive function, and alterations in behavioural patterns. It is the most prevalent cause of dementia among older adults, impacting approximately 50 million individuals worldwide. The underlying processes involved in the pathophysiology of AD are intricate and involve various molecular and cellular mechanisms. These include the formation of neurofibrillary tangles, beta-amyloid plaques, and an increased risk of neuroinflammation. Beta-amyloid plaque formation in the brain is one of the symptoms of AD. The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is converted into the peptide beta-amyloid by the actions of the two enzymes beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Beta-amyloid accumulates in the brain of AD patients because of an imbalance in the synthesis and elimination of the protein. Insoluble plaques formed from aggregated beta-amyloid impair neuronal transmission, cause neuroinflammation, and eventually result in synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration. Neurofibrillary tangles are another characteristic of AD. Neurofibrillary tangles comprise hyperphosphorylated tau protein, which aggregates to form intracellular filaments. Tau protein is usually involved in stabilizing microtubules in neurons, which are essential for maintaining neuronal structure and function. The aberrant hyperphosphorylation of tau protein in AD causes it to aggregate and form neurofibrillary tangles. These tangles prevent neurons from functioning normally and cause their degeneration. Another important aspect of AD is neuroinflammation. It is characterised by the production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species by activated microglia and astrocytes. Neuroinflammation exacerbates beta-amyloid deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation, leading to increased neuronal damage and death. The onset of AD is also influenced by genetic factors. People with early-onset familial AD have been shown to have mutations in the genes for presenilin 1 (PSEN1), amyloid precursor protein (APP), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2). These mutations increase beta-amyloid production and its accumulation in the brain, leading to the development of AD at a younger age."
