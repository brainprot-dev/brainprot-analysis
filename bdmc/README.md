# Brain Disease Marker Curator (BDMC) curation pipeline.

## Introduction
Brain Disease Marker Curator (BDMC) allows users to select and identify disease associated markers of more than 50 Human Brain Diseases. BDMC integrates the power of popular knowledgebases and public resources like  DisGeNET, Harmonizome 3.0, PubPular 3.1, CTD,  Disease 2.0,  BIONDA, and eDGAR,  to calculate the BDMC score. The domain aims to accelerate the quest of search for brain disease biomarker.

## Data Curation
We use the diseases table from HBDA for curation in BDMC.
