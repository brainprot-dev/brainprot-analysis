# Inter-hemispheric Brain Proteome Map (IBPM) Analysis Pipeline

## Domain Introduction
The [https://brainprot.org/ibpm](IBPM) domain of BrainProt conducts a comprehensive analysis of protein expression profiles and phosphosite characterization in specific regions of the human brain's left and right hemispheres. It provides information on over 3000 proteins and 46,000 peptides, visualized through a Bar Plot showing profiles for the hemispheres and regions. IBPM aims to enhance our understanding of hemisphere functionality related to dominance, lateralization, and the development of brain disorders. Recently, the phosphoproteome section has been integrated under the PhosphoMap. Users can search and access protein expression, peptide information, phosphosite identification, and other valuable brain resources. The portal strives to bridge the gap and complement the efforts of the Human Brain Proteome Project (HBPP) under the patronage of the Human Proteome Organization (HUPO).
